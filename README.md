My name is Eric Mesaros. I am a website designer and web developer based in Northeast, Pennsylvania.
I have over 13 years of experience working on websites.

I am an extremely tenacious and ambitious individual, always trying to bring innovation to projects I work on.
Professionalism and integrity are traits I care very deeply about, and I never sacrifice quality.

As a kid I always loved to draw, trying to meticulously capture the world around me on paper.
I always knew I would grow up to be an artist and designer;
but I attribute my career success to having studied renaissance art and design at the <a id="Barnstone-Studios" href="https://www.barnstonestudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Barnstone Studios</a> in Coplay, PA, as an adolescent.
There, I learned the geometry, and color theory that are the foundation of many great works of art.

My fascination with art as a communication tool spans various industries.
I'm the guy who will study the head-up display while my wife watches a football game rather than watching the game itself,
or study the package design of a toy while I am in line to purchase the toy for one of my children.

While preparing for college in 2003, I decided to hand-code my first online portfolio to showcase my artwork.
During this time, I unexpectedly fell in love with the medium.
Unlike my artistic background, most of the coding knowledge and expertise I acquired was accomplished through self motivation and self initiated learning.
Articles, books and coworkers proved to be valuable resources for my professional development.

When I am not designing and coding websites, I spend most of my time with my wife and two children.
I volunteer in both the drama and childrenâ€™s ministries at our church.
I am a Tang Soo Do martial artist practicing self-defence training and physical fitness.
I love that I share this activity with both of my children.
In my leisure time, I enjoy board games, video games, table-top roleplaying games, and gardening.
